COL5A1:
	Gene which encodes the instructions to make the type V collagen. 
	Collagen is an important protein which promotes growth and repair in connective tissue and other import soft tissue.
	A study by Dr. Anne De Paepe et al. found that mutations within COL5A1 are causal in both types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. (Genetic Disorder that weakens connective tissue) And another study by Dr. Zulek et al. which investigated the correlation between COL5A1 and carpal tunnel.
	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9042913/
	I initially selected the CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing) population to do a study on because I found an article which found correlations between genetic variation in COL5A1 (and two other COL _ A1 genes) with ligament injuries in this population.
	Going in, I hypothesize that COL5A1 would shows signs of selective pressure because of the background information I was reading and the essential function I found. 
	However the mains things I'm curious about is exploring to see what genetic diversity exists within this gene where the phenotype is an essential part of the body. I also wanted to explore some of the snps I found in my research to see if they were under selective pressure. 
	"9:134651496:G:A"
	"9:134654639:C:A" Very Very Unlikely 
	I found 53 snps out of HWE 
	Right now my plan is to contiune through the modules. I plan to focus on detecting inbreeding and also 
	checking linkage disequilibrium to see if some of the 53 significant snps I found are inheirited together. Basically looking for selective sweeps.
	I ignored blocks which were less than 5 pairs long for brevities sake

	Number of records: 1617
	Number of SNPS: 1361
	Number of indels: 256
